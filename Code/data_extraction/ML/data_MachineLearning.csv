Io attivo un crowdfunding per ricomprare il computer che si è rotto all’improvviso (che mi serve per lavorare, quindi non avendo i soldi per ricomprare il computer non lavoro e se non lavoro continuerò a non avere i soldi): in 24 ore ricevo 15k insulti.

Il consiglio più gettonato?
“Vai a lavorare e compratelo.”
Ma è proprio per poter lavorare che chiedo una mano a ricomprare il computer 🤣
